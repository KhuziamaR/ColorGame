RGB Color Game using HTML CSS and JavaScript

This is a Game I built using HTML , CSS , and Java Script! I was inspired to make this exciting project from The WebDevelopment BootCamp By Colt Steel on Udemy!

The idea of the game is to have the user guess which color is represented by the RBG value that is displayed. The RBG model represents which color you get by mixing R- Red , B- Blue, G- Green light, The goal of the game is to guess which color you get by mixing a certain value of each!

To play the game, you can simply download the 3 files: colorGame.html colorGame.css colorGame.js NOTE * You must have the files in the same directory.

To run the program, you have a few options:
1- Download the Code as a zip file using the green download button! 2- Double click the colorGame.html File Or drag the colorGame.html file onto Google Chrome! 3- Guess what color the RGB values on the top represent! :)
